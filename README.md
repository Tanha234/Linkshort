# LinkShort -  URL Shortener
## 📖 Project Overview
A modern, full-stack URL shortener application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It features a premium glassmorphism UI, advanced analytics, and user authentication via Firebase.
# 📖 Project Overview
**LinkShort** is a sophisticated, full-stack URL shortening service designed with a focus on **visual aesthetics** and **user experience**. Unlike generic shorteners, LinkShort provides a premium "Glassmorphism" interface, detailed analytics, and a seamless flow for managing your digital footprint.

It allows users to:
- Instantly shorten long, complex URLs into clean, shareable links.
- Track performance with real-time analytics (clicks, trends).
- Manage their links via a personal dashboard.
- Customize their profile and view aggregate statistics.

## 🛠 How It Works

1.  **Sign Up / Login**: Users create an account using their email and password via **Firebase Authentication**.
2.  **Shorten a Link**:
    - Navigate to the **LinkPop** page (or Home).
    - Paste your long URL > Click **Shorten**.
    - Copy your new short link instantly.
3.  **Share**: Distribute your link on social media, emails, or messages.
4.  **Track**:
    - Go to your **Dashboard** to see a list of all your links.
    - View total clicks, top-performing links, and activity graphs.
5.  **Analyze**: Visit your **Profile** for a visual breakdown of your overall engagement.

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

We leverage **Firebase Authentication** to provide robust and secure identity management.

### Key Features:
-   **Email/Password Sign-up**: Secure registration flow.
-   **Password Reset**: Users can request a password reset link via the `/forgot-password` route if they lose access to their account.
-   **Email Verification**: (Supported by Firebase) Accounts are secure, and verification emails can be triggered to ensure valid user identities.
-   **Session Management**: Persistent login sessions using Firebase's efficient observer pattern (`onAuthStateChanged`).

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm installed
- MongoDB URI (local or Atlas)
- Firebase Project configured

### 1. Clone the repository

## 🎨 Design Decisions

1.  **Glassmorphism UI**: Utilized `backdrop-blur`, translucent whites (`bg-white/50`), and soft gradients to create a modern, depth-rich interface.
2.  **Animation**: `Framer Motion` powers the staggered reveals, hover effects, and smooth page transitions.
3.  **Data Visualization**: `Recharts` integrates beautiful area charts directly into the Profile and Dashboard for instant insights.
4.  **Tailwind CSS**: Efficient utility-first styling allows for rapid responsive design and easy theming (Primary Color: `#E2852E`).

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1.  **Usage Limits**: Free accounts are limited to **100 URLs**. A simulated "Upgrade" flow exists for demonstration.
2.  **Payment Processing**: The upgrade payment process is currently a **simulation** (UI only) and does not process real money.
3.  **Local Development**: Short links generated locally point to `localhost`. Update the base URL in production for live sharing.
